# Election-Data
Read and analyze election data. Data analysis is mainly for parlimentary democracies (like Canada).

Data is given in a csv format (each line represents a row in a table, and commas are used as separators to indicate cells within the row). Empty cells are represented using double commas. The data file should begin with a header line that contains column names rather than data. Attached is a sample file.
